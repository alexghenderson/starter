## Todo:
- Set up server side rendering
  - Use puppeteer? Limit to mobile or bots?
  - Or how to solve data fetching (preferably without hoisting data fetching to page like nextJS or tying to redux
- Set up e2e tests
- Set up CI
  - CircleCI? Or Travis? Or...?
  - Should be relatively straight forward for validating build passes tests
